1. The description does not say which member of `core` owns the 10G and 25G connections, or which VLANs the fw-2 cable carries; the format can represent the unspecified details by omitting them. It also does not identify a segment for the IPsec tunnel.
2. I added IDs for the staff routed network, the VLAN segments, the redundancy set, and the access point. I treated “believed to be on the 2nd floor” as an assumed node in that group, and interpreted the tunnel as a virtual link. The description does not explicitly say the staff VLAN is confined to the server room, so that group assignment is an assumption and could be omitted.
3. The format says a node’s `network` can describe its attachment “as a whole,” but does not clarify how that relates to a node’s presence in multiple segments. It also does not specify whether endpoint ports can be used for virtual tunnel interfaces, or how to represent a member of a stack when the specific member is unknown.
