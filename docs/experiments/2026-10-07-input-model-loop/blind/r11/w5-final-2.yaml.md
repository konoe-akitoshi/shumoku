1. **Could not express:** The VM’s attachment specifically to `vSwitch0`; the format says a VM’s adapter is not a link, but has no field for the virtual switch name. The IPsec tunnel is marked virtual, but there is no field to specify that it uses IPsec.
2. **Guesses or additions:** I named the shared firewall address holder `fw-ha`, represented the unknown VLANs on fw-2’s cable as a segment named `vlan-unknown`, and gave the assumed access point the ID `ap-1`. I also added node types and labels based on the descriptions.
3. **Unclear:** The types do not say whether a node address should be represented in `Segment.addresses` when the node’s segment is unknown. I used an extra segment for the core management address and for fw-2’s unspecified cable VLANs, though neither VLAN is actually identified.
