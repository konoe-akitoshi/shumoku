1. **Could not express:** The tunnel is described as going “over” the tunnel to the head office firewalls, but the link model only connects two endpoints; it cannot represent an unspecified underlay path. The format also has no explicit port-group or virtual-switch node, so the VM attachment is represented through a routing domain.
2. **Guesses or additions:** I used `vSwitch0` as a routing domain because the format has no port-group type. I treated the firewall pair’s shared address as an address belonging to the redundancy set. I chose IDs and generic node `type` values where the description supplied no schema vocabulary. I placed the branch router in the branch group and the AP in the 2nd-floor group based on the description.
3. **Unclear in the format:** It says a routing domain is a separate routing domain such as a VPC or VRF, but does not clarify whether a virtual switch or port group qualifies. It also does not specify a naming convention or controlled vocabulary for `type`, or whether links to a segment are preferred over listing the segment in `segments` when describing a node’s attachment.
