1. The format cannot express the access point’s location as unconfirmed separately from its existence; `assumed: true` marks the node itself as unconfirmed.
2. I used `ap-1` as an identifier because none was given. I treated the VM’s attachment to `vSwitch0` as a virtual link to VLAN 10, and the IPsec tunnel as a virtual link. The format has no field for the tunnel protocol beyond the connection label.
3. It is unclear whether a link with `segments` lists all segments it carries or only known ones. The type comment says the listed segments are exhaustive, so I left the fw-2 link’s segments unspecified. It is also unclear whether `host` should refer to a redundancy set’s ID only when the exact host is unknown; here the VM’s host is known, so I used `esx-1`.
