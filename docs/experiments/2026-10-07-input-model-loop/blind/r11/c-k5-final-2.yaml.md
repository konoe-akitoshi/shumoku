1. The format does not directly express that the firewalls share a virtual IP address while each has its own address in the same segment: `addresses` can record the virtual address under the redundancy set, but the shared-address relationship is not separately described. I used the redundancy set ID as the address key.
2. I added identifiers for the groups, segments, connection, and the unconfirmed AP (`ap-1`), since the format requires IDs. I treated the VM's attachment to vSwitch0 as a virtual link from the VM to a segment and listed VLAN 10 on that link. The description does not say the tunnel carries no segments; the empty list is intended to say it carries none, so that may overstate what is known.
3. It is unclear whether `segments: []` means the tunnel is known to carry no segments or whether it can represent “unknown.” The type comment says a link that lists its segments carries those and no others, but does not define the meaning of an empty list.
