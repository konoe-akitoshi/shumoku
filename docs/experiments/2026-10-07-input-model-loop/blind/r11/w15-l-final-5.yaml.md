1. The description does not say which VLANs the fw-2 cable carries or which ports it uses; the format can leave those unknown. It also does not identify the segment for the core’s management address, so it is recorded as a node address.
2. I represented the shared HA address under the redundancy set’s ID, and modeled the VM’s VLAN attachment as a link to the segment. I assumed the IPsec tunnel is virtual. I also guessed node types, the VMware software label, and IDs/labels where the description gave no canonical values.
3. The format says a VPN can be a connection made of multiple links, but does not clearly specify how to model a tunnel endpoint such as `tun0` on both devices without duplicating the tunnel link. I included one link with each endpoint’s `tun0` port; the first IPsec link is redundant and should be omitted.
